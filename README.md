Revised July 12th, 2024

## Quick Reference

| Method      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Primary     | Voice calls and text messaging via cell phone |
| Alternate   | E-mail via cell phone, computer, or tablet    |
| Contingency | Text messaging via Spot-X satellite messenger |
| Emergency   | Voice via handheld FM radio, or digital messaging via HF radio |

## Overview

A P.A.C.E. plan is a method of planning that identifies Primary, Alternate, Contingency, and Emergency methods of communication for a specific group. The communication methods are identified in order of preference, beginning with the primary communication method. When the preferred method of communication is unavailable, the next method of communication is used. This process continues until communication has been established.

The following plan template is designed to ensure reliable communication in a variety of situations. Each communication method has been chosen for variation (aka differentiation) in underlying infrastructure and equipment requirements. Equipment has been chosen based on availability, ease of use, and cost (one-time and reoccuring) for the average user.

Take the following steps with your group:
1) Review the following PACE plan
2) Make adjustments to the PACE plan to best fit the needs of your group
3) Add details such as phone numbers, email addresses, radio frequencies, and other reference information
4) Print and store paper copies of the PACE plan with your communication equipment
5) Review and practice your PACE plan on a regular basis to build faimiliarity and identify opportunities for improvement

## Primary - Cell Phone Network
### Recommendation: Voice calls and text messaging via cell phone

Cell phones are a commonly used and accessible method of communication. They are portable and easy to use for both voice calls and text messages. It is important to consider that during emergencies, cell phone networks can become overloaded and may not be available. If a voice call cannot get through or is unreliable, a text message will often still get through.

When the cell phone network or associated equipment is unavailable, use the Alternate communication method.

#### Equipment Recommendations
- Cell phone
- [USB charging cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07215381G/)
- [USB wall charger](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GSDZKPD/)
- [USB vehicle charger](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PGT7LSR/)
- [USB battery pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Z9QVE4Q/)
- [Portable solar panel](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012YZXMZS/)

#### Considerations
- Identify alternative charging options
- Use encrypted apps for secure communications (ex. Signal, Telegram, [Sideband](https://github.com/markqvist/Sideband/releases/latest))

#### Differentiation
Infrastructure: Cell phone network  
Equipment: Cell phone

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Alternate - Internet
### Recommendation: E-mail via cell phone, computer, or tablet

Any internet communication service is acceptable, just make sure it is accessible to everyone you plan to communicate with, and is available from any internet connected device. E-mail is a common method of internet-based communication. Any computer or tablet can provide access to a web-based e-mail account if a cell phone is lost or damaged. The internet may be available even if the cell phone network is unavailable. However, internet access can be interrupted during a power outage or other emergency. 

When the internet or associated equipment is unavailable, use the Contingency communication method.

#### Equipment Recommendations
- Laptop computer or tablet
- Charging cable
- Wall charger
- [Vehicle inverter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09WYPCMT4/?th=1)

#### Considerations
- Identify different computers for internet and HF radio use
- Add Spot-X satellite messenger phone number as a Google account verification option (see Appendix A)
- Know how to access web based e-mail from a device other than the one you typically use
- Do not use services that are only available as a cell phone app
- Public WiFi may be available at gas stations and fast food resturants

#### Differentiation
Infrastructure: Internet  
Equipment: Computer or tablet

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Contingency - Satellite
### Recommendation: Text messaging via Spot-X satellite messenger

Satellite networks are a reliable form of communication when local infrastructure is unavailable. Voice, messaging, and internet connectivity options are available, some of which may be too expensive for the average user. The Spot-X satellite messenger has a small keyboard, making it a stand-alone device. It also has a dedicated phone number which supports two-way text messaging (incoming and outgoing). The Spot-X uses the GlobalStar satellite network, and monthly or annual subscription plans are reasonably priced. See the global coverage map in Appendix B.

When the satellite network or associated equipment is unavailable, use the Emergency communication method.

#### Equipment Recommendations
- [Spot-X satellite messenger](https://www.findmespot.com/en-us/products-services/spot-x)
- [USB charging cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07215381G/)
- [USB wall charger](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GSDZKPD/)
- [USB vehicle charger](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PGT7LSR/)
- [USB battery pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Z9QVE4Q/)
- [Portable solar panel](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012YZXMZS/)

#### Considerations
- Initial account and subscription setup requires internet access
- Enable subscription auto-renew to ensure availability
- Requires a clear view of the sky to reliably communicate (i.e. not indoors)

#### Differentiation
Infrastructure: GlobalStar satellite network  
Equipment: Spot-X satellite messenger

## Emergency - Radio
### Recommendation: Voice via handheld FM radio, or digital messaging via HF radio

Different types of radio based communication may be required depending on the distance to the intended contact. Voice communication via a handlheld FM radio may be appropriate if your group is within a few miles of your location, or when you are traveling together. Digital messaging via HF radio may be required if your group is spread over hundreds or thousands of miles. Radio based communication has no underlying infrastructure requirements. However, the equipment is less readily available, has a steeper learning curve, and may require a license to operate legally.

For local communication via a handheld FM radio, several inexpensive Baofeng radios can be effective once configured correctly. Handheld FM radios are available for licensed services (amateur radio) and unlicensed services (MURS or FRS).

For long range communication via a HF radio, JS8Call modem software and the QRPLabs QDX digital tranceiver offer the least complexity and the most consistent communication link reliability. The addition of the [Portal Messenger](https://github.com/simplyequipped/portalmessenger) software application can reduce the complexity and learning curve. Operation in the 40m (7 MHz) amateur radio band is recommended for digital messaging.

If radio communication or associated equipment is unavailable, you can always talk to yourself. Sanity not guaranteed :P
